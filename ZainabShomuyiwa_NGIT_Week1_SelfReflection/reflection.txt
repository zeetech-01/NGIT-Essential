Week 1 Self-Reflection

It is important to understand computers, operating systems, and how the web works because they are the basics of using technology. Knowing how a computer works helps me understand how files are created, saved, and used. Understanding the operating system helps me know how to use the computer properly and fix simple problems. Learning how the web works helps me understand how websites are opened and how information is sent and received on the internet. Even without knowing web development yet, these basics make it easier to learn new digital skills. They also help me feel more confident using technology.
