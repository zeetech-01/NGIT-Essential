1. A computer is an electronic device that accepts data as input, processes it according to instructions, stores it, and produces output.

-Hardware refers to the physical parts of a computer that can be seen and touched, such as the keyboard, monitor, CPU, and mouse.
-Software refers to the programs and applications that tell the computer what to do, such as Windows, Microsoft Word, web browsers, and antivirus software.

2. An operating system is system software that manages the computer’s hardware and software resources and provides services for computer programs.
Two primary functions of an operating system are:
- Managing hardware resources such as memory, processor, and storage.
- Providing an interface that allows users to interact with the computer.                                                                                    
3. Differences between Windows and Linux
Windows and Linux are both operating systems, but they’re a bit different:
- Interface: Windows is easier to use because of its visuals. Linux sometimes needs commands typed in, especially for advanced stuff.
- Software: Windows runs most commercial programs and games. Linux mostly uses free, open-source software.
- Security: Linux is usually safer from viruses, partly because fewer people use it and its permissions system is stricter.                                                                                                                                                                            
4. Explain these terms: File, Folder, File Extension
-File: A file is something that stores information, like a document, image, or video.
-Folder (Directory): A folder is a container for files or other folders, helping you stay organized.
-File Extension: The letters after a file name, like .txt or .jpg, tell the computer what type of file it is.

5. What is the command line and why is it important?
The command line is a way to tell your computer what to do by typing commands instead of clicking. It’s important for developers because it’s fast, powerful, and often needed for coding, file management, and running programs.
                                                                                                                                                                                                    6. Internet terms:
-Server: A computer that stores and sends data to other computers.
-Browser: A program like Chrome or Firefox that lets you visit websites.
-IP Address: A unique number that identifies a computer on the internet.
-DNS: A system that translates website names (like google.com) into IP addresses.
-HTTP & HTTPS: Both let your browser communicate with websites. HTTPS is secure, meaning the data is encrypted.

7. Client–Server Model
The client–server model is like ordering at a restaurant:
-Client: You, the customer, asking for something (like your computer requesting a website).
-Server: The kitchen, which prepares what you asked for and sends it back.
