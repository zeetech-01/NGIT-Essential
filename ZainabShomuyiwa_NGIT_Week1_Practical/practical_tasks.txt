Step 1: Open VS Code
I opened Visual Studio Code on my computer. It’s a program that lets you write code in an organized way and see your files clearly.
Step 2: Open my project folder
Inside VS Code, I opened the folder called web_basics that I created earlier. This way, all my files and subfolders are in one place and easy to manage.
Step 3: Create a new file in the projects folder
I went into the projects folder and created a new file called index.html. This file will be the first webpage I’m making.
Step 4: Write my first HTML code
Inside index.html, I typed a simple HTML page:
<!DOCTYPE html> tells the browser it’s an HTML document.
<html>, <head>, and <body> set up the structure of the webpage.
<title> gives the page a title that shows in the browser tab.
<h1>Hello, NGIT!</h1> shows a big heading on the page so I can see it works.

Task 4: Internet & Web Observation
- I opened my web browser and visited google.com.
- The domain name of the website is 'google.com'.
- I noticed that the website uses HTTPS, which means it is secure and any information sent or received is protected.
- When I pressed Enter, my computer sent a request to the website’s server. The server then sent back the files for the webpage, and my browser displayed the page so I could see it. 
- This shows how computers, the internet, and browsers work together to show websites.
